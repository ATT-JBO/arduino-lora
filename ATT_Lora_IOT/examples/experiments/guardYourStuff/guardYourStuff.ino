/****
 *  AllThingsTalk Developer Cloud IoT experiment for LoRa
 *  version 1.0 dd 09/11/2015
 *  Original author: Jan Bogaerts 2015
 *
 *  This sketch is part of the AllThingsTalk LoRa rapid development kit
 *  -> http://www.allthingstalk.com/lora-rapid-development-kit
 *
 *  This example sketch is based on the Proxilmus IoT network in Belgium
 *  The sketch and libs included support the
 *  - MicroChip RN2483 LoRa module
 *  - Embit LoRa modem EMB-LR1272
 *  
 *  For more information, please check our documentation
 *  -> http://docs.smartliving.io/kits/lora
 *
 * EXPLENATION:
 *
 * If the accelerometer senses movement, the device will send out GPS coordinates. If we have our lock turned on,
 * movement will trigger a notification which will be visible in the SmartLiving Developer Cloud and on our Smartphone.
 * If the lock is turned off, nothing will happen, regardless of any movement of the device.
